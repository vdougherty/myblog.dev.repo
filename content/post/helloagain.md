Apologies for the prolonged absence, but the blog is back and running after a year of basically being on the back burner. The unfortunate thing is that the last backup was from January of 2023, and in my hamfisted attempt to get my blog up and runnings, I accidentally deleted my local repo, except for the backup which was then used recently to resurrect the current blog. Lesson learned. 

Suffice to say, a lot has changed over this past year, but in general things are good. So with out much further ado, I'll be posting on what ever subject strikes my fancy. I’ll write about art, music, Linux, guitars and living life on life’s terms. I plan to post every couple of weeks or so, please feel free to check back.

\-Love and rockets
