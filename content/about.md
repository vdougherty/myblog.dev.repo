## Well, hello there...

I live in the PNW, as a recent transplant from the city of Chicago. I'm an artist,  a musician, a generalist in all geek/nerd sub-culture, and a daily user of Linux. I'm a trained Illustrator (multiple years of drawing naked people in art school, to get my degree) who fell into Web Design/Development. I was lucky, when after my first-semester of Web Design, a major ad agency selected me to work in their bustling Chicago-office. My first assignment was working on  Budweiser.com as part of a larger ad-campaign. I find myself luckier still, that I was able to spring board that into a career that has now lasted longer than 20 years.

I'm currently the principle illustrator for a web comic that I started with my daughter, who happens to be my favorite writer (no bias). At last count, the comic spans over 260 pages and over the course of 3 books; crammed with wholesome, comic goodness. The plot is focused on the adventures/misadventures of a family, whose primary occupation is the {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://helsigcomix.wordpress.com/comic/helsig-introduction-book-one/" target="_blank">occult and hunting vampires</a>.{{< /rawhtml >}} It's been on hiatus for awhile, as the writer has been pursuing her masters (priorities) and moving to the PNW with me, not to mention establishing her career. 

As a musician, I've been fortunate to have played with some truly gifted and great people. I've been signed, reviewed in the AP. My songs were played on the radio in Chicago. I've opened for countless Chicago bands, even sharing the bill with Dee Dee Ramone. I am humbled and grateful, that in it’s summation, I’ve had a chance to do some pretty cool things. Since arriving in Portland, I’ve joined a new group, which is actively in rehearsal.
